\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
The bazo blockchain application consists of two command-line tools called bazo{\_}miner and bazo{\_}client. Both tools are needed to run and interact with the blockchain. Every bazo{\_}miner stores all the blockchain and state data in its built-in storage component, however there is no way for a user to browse through that data using a GUI. Information about the health and productivity of the system are not available either. This is why a blockchain explorer is needed, a seperate service that lets users examine the blockchain data, without directly taking part in the network. 

\section{Description of Work}
This thesis documents the design and implementation of a blockchain explorer for the private blockchain bazo and its corresponding cryptocurrency bazocoin. The explorer allows users and admins of Bazo to inspect and analyze data regarding the bazo blockchain. Blocks, transactions and accounts are being displayed in an informative and well-structured manner, with the explorer acting as a visualizer for the blockchain. Statistical information about the blockchain will also be made available to the user. Furthermore the explorer features admin-only functionality, serving as a GUI for setting various system parameters from the web via a gateway to the Bazo network.

\section{Thesis Outline}
Chapter 2 introduces the bazo blockchain and analyzes existing blockchain explorers and statistics analysis platforms. Chapter 3 focuses on the design of the bazo explorer, consisting of both, the frontend and its corresponding backend. Chapter 4 documents the implementation of the web application, followed by an evaluation in chapter 5. A summary and conclusions are presented in chapter 6.
