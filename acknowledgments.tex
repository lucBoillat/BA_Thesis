I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Bocek for his continuous support and inspiring enthusiasm regarding peer-to-peer  and blockchain technologies. While working on the thesis, his insight into these matters provided valuable information and a pleasant environment to work in.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller for letting me write this bachelor's thesis at the Communication Systems Reasearch Group of the University of Zurich.
